  Hope all is well.<br>
  It has been two months into my fall semester at Rochester.<br>
  I finally came to realize that I do not want to major in Computer Science.<br>
  I also discovered an inclination towards writing. I regularly blog now.<br>
  I had some issues with my class schedule in the beginning but all is good now.<br>
  I am making a cool project for my HCI class with a team of four people.<br>
  I have midterms coming up next week. I will be coming back home for Thanksgiving. Take care.<br>

Best,
Sar

I recently moved to Austin, Texas. I got a better job opportunity at the owfices of  IBM as a senior product manager.<br>
Tom is starting a new division of his retail business here in Austin.<br>
Kids are taking some time getting used to the new school. I hope they feel comfortable with the new environment soon.<br>
We have fortunately found a great home in a safe neighborhood.<br>
 I am still shopping around to get the kids enrolled in some after school activities.<br>
 I am having a house warming party soon. It would be a good way of getting to know our neighbours.<br>
  Let me know if you visit Austin anytime soon.<br>

Best,
Sally
